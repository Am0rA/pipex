open, close, read, and write are used for file I/O. These functions allow you to open, close, read from, and write to files.
malloc and free are used for dynamic memory allocation. malloc allocates memory on the heap (dynamic memory), and free frees memory that was previously allocated with malloc.
perror is used to print an error message to the standard error output stream (stderr). It is often used in conjunction with system calls that return an error code.
strerror is used to convert an error code (such as the value of errno) to a human-readable string.
access is used to check the accessibility of a file. It can check whether a file exists, whether the process has permission to read or write to the file, and other attributes.
dup and dup2 are used to duplicate file descriptors. They can be used to redirect the standard input, output, and error streams to files or pipes.
execve is used to execute a program. It replaces the current process with a new program.
exit is used to exit a process. It terminates the current process and returns a status code to the parent process.
fork is used to create a new process by duplicating the calling process.
pipe is used to create a pipe, a unidirectional data channel that can be used for interprocess communication.
unlink is used to delete a file.
wait and waitpid are used to wait for a child process to complete. They allow the parent process to wait until the child process has terminated before continuing.
